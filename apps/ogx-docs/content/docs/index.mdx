OGX is a TypeScript framework for generating Open Graph images using a Tailwind-like syntax. It's built to eliminate the friction between design and implementation for social sharing metadata.

## Philosophy

OGX is built on three core pillars:

1.  **Tailwind as the Language**: We believe utility classes are the most ergonomic way to build layouts for the web. OGX brings this same experience to image generation.
2.  **Framework Agnostic Core**: The engine works everywhere—Node.js, Edge, or the Browser. High-level adapters provide a native experience for your favorite framework.
3.  **Developer Experience First**: From declarative font loading to automatic caching, every API is designed to get out of your way.

## Why OGX?

Generating OG images used to be a choice between two evils: **Puppeteer** (heavy, slow, resource-intensive) or **Canvas/Satori** (manual, verbose, hard to style).

OGX provides the best of both worlds: the performance of a native renderer with the ease of use of a modern CSS framework.

### What OGX Fixes

-   **Manual Tailwind Parsing**: Stop manually converting Tailwind classes to Satori-compatible style objects. OGX handles the parsing and conversion for you.
-   **Messy Architectures**: Instead of 200 lines of nested objects for a simple layout, use the **Fluent Builder API** or **JSX** to create clean, readable code.
-   **Resource Management**: Static Node.js imports and local font files often leak or break in Serverless/Edge environments. OGX uses dynamic imports and browser-safe fallbacks by default.

## Technical Stack

OGX stands on the shoulders of giants:

-   **[Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori)**: The engine that converts HTML/CSS to SVG.
-   **[Resvg](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js)**: A high-performance Rust-based SVG to PNG converter (server-only).
-   **Tailwind Parser**: Our custom utility that transforms TW classes into inline styles.
-   **CDN Font Loading**: Simplified registration of fonts like Inter directly from Google Fonts or CDNs.

### Browser Compatible

Unlike most OG image generators, OGX can run **directly in the browser** for live previews. The core rendering engine has zero Node.js dependencies when using the `/svg` module path.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { fontRegistry } from '@ogxjs/core';
import { ogx } from '@ogxjs/core/png';

// Register fonts once
await fontRegistry.registerInter([400, 700]);

// Build a documentation-style image in seconds
const png = await ogx({
  preset: 'docs',
  title: 'Introduction',
  description: 'Tailwind-first OG image generation',
  colorScheme: 'dark',
});
```

## Architecture

OGX is organized into three layers:

-   **@ogxjs/core**: The engine. Handles layout building, tailwind parsing, and image rendering.
-   **Adapters**: Framework-specific wrappers (`@ogxjs/next`, `@ogxjs/react`) for zero-config integration.
-   **Presets**: Battle-tested templates for common use cases (Blogs, Docs, Social).
