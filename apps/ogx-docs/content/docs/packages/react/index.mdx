description: Build OG images using JSX and React components
---

The `@ogxjs/react` adapter allows you to build OG images using familiar JSX syntax. It's designed for both server-side rendering and client-side previews.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @ogxjs/react @ogxjs/core
```

## Basic Usage

The primary way to use `@ogxjs/react` is through the `toOGX` function, which converts React elements into OGX elements that can be rendered to PNG or SVG.

```tsx
import { toOGX } from '@ogxjs/react';
import { render } from '@ogxjs/react/png';

const MyOGImage = () => (
  <div tw="flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-zinc-950 w-full h-full text-white">
    <h1 tw="text-6xl font-bold">Hello React</h1>
    <p tw="text-2xl text-zinc-400">Built with OGX</p>
  </div>
);

// png is a Buffer (Node.js/Server only)
const png = await render(<MyOGImage />);
```

## The `tw` Prop

OGX augments React's types to include a `tw` prop on standard HTML elements. This allows you to use Tailwind CSS utility classes directly.

```tsx
<div tw="bg-blue-500 p-8 rounded-xl shadow-2xl">
  <span tw="text-white font-medium">Coming Soon</span>
</div>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to import `@ogxjs/react` or include its types in your `tsconfig.json` to get full autocomplete for the `tw` prop.

## Browser Support

One of the best features of `@ogxjs/react` is its full browser compatibility. You can create live previews using `renderToSVG` from the browser-safe module.

```tsx
import { renderToSVG } from '@ogxjs/react/svg';

const svg = await renderToSVG(<MyOGImage />);
// Use svg directly in dangerouslySetInnerHTML
```
