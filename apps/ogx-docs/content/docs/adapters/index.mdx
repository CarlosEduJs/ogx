description: Using OGX with your favorite frameworks

OGX provides high-level adapters for popular web frameworks to make generating OG images even easier. These adapters handle boilerplate like response headers, font loading, and type-safe component integration.

## Available Adapters

</Cards>

## Core Principles

All OGX adapters follow these principles:

1. **Native Feel**: They leverage the framework's own patterns (e.g., JSX for React, Route Handlers for Next.js).
2. **Performance**: Optimized for fast generation and proper caching.
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with framework-specific typings.
4. **Declarative**: Focus on *what* you want to build, not *how* to handle the underlying response logic.

## Which one should I use?

- Use **@ogxjs/react** if you want to build OG images using JSX, whether in a browser (for previews) or on a server.
- Use **@ogxjs/next** if you are building a Next.js App Router application and want the easiest way to serve OG images.
